    "Imagine you are a computational linguist hired by the government to help communicate with a group of Aliens that recently landed on Earth. These extraterrestrials speak a non-human language that called language X (for extraterrestrial). Luckily, your linguistics partner arrived at the scene before you and was able to generate English translations for some basic words in language X. She has determined that the aliens want to give humans a message. As her computational linguist counterpart, it is your job to **translate longer messages in language X to English using code**.  \n",
