# Lists of Other Types

Watch the full [C# 101 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIQdb93xewE&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVxKLQCHpiUWun7vlJJvUiN&index=14) for this module.

You've been practicing lists of strings, but you can make a list of anything! Here's a number example. 

## Fibonacci

Fibonacci is a cool number sequence. It adds up the last two numbers up to make the next number. You start with 1 and 1  
1 + 1 = 2  (1, 1, 2)  
1 + 2 = 3  (1, 1, 2, 3)  
2 + 3 = 5  (1, 1, 2, 3, 5)  
3 + 5 = 8  (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)  
and so on. There's lots of stuff in nature that follow this number sequence, and has lots of cool stuff if you want to look it up!  

> Start with the base numbers: Here's a list with just 1, 1 in it. Run it and see what happens.

#!csharp

var fibonacciNumbers = new List<int> {1, 1};

foreach (var item in fibonacciNumbers)
    Console.WriteLine(item);

#!markdown

Now, you don't want just 1,1 in it! You want more of the sequence. In this code, you're using the last two numbers of the list, adding them together to make the next number, then adding it to the list. 

> Run the code to try it out

#!csharp

var fibonacciNumbers = new List<int> {1, 1}; // Starting the list off with the basics

var previous = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 1]; // take the last number in the list
var previous2 = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 2]; // take the second to last number in the list

fibonacciNumbers.Add(previous + previous2); // add the previous numbers together, and attach the sum to the end of the list

foreach (var item in fibonacciNumbers) // print out the list
    Console.WriteLine(item);

#!markdown

## Count -1

Why do you need to do `fibonacciNumbers.Count -1` to get the last number of the list? Well, count tells you how many items are in a list. However, the index of an item start at zero. So, if you only had one item in your list, the count would be one, but the index if the item would be 0. The index and count of the last item is always one off.

# Challenge: Fibonacci to 20th number

You've given you a base of code that deals with Fibonacci. Can you make a list that has the first 20 fibonacci numbers?

>Make and print a list that has the first 20 fibonacci numbers

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Challenge");

## Hints and Tricks

- The final number should be 6765
- Could you make a forloop? A foreach loop? A while loop? Which kind of loop do you prefer, and which would be more useful?
- Are you getting close, but are one number off? That's a really common issue! remember that `>` and `>=` are similar, but end up being one off from the other. Try playing around with that?
- Remember that you're starting with two items in the list already.
- Stuck? Watch the [C# 101 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIQdb93xewE&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVxKLQCHpiUWun7vlJJvUiN&index=14) for this module. Try out pausing once you get an idea and trying it out first before watching the rest.
