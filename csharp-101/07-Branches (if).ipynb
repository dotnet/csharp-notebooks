## Basic If 

If statements makes decisions.

> try out our first if statement:

#!csharp

int a = 5;
int b = 6;
if (a + b > 10)
    Console.WriteLine("The answer is greater than 10.");

#!markdown

In words, this if statement is saying "if a plus b is greater than 10, write the line 'The answer is greater than 10'". 
> What would happen if a + b is less than 10? Try editing the above code to see.

Did nothing happen? That's great! Since the the **conditions** (a + b is greater than 10) of the if statement weren't met, the code didn't go into the if statement, and therefore had nothing to print.

## What's a Condition?

The `condition` is the statement in parentheses after the `if`. A `condition` is a boolean, which means it has to return a true or false. that means using symbols such as `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `==`.
> Practice boolean statements. Try out some different symbols and numbers to see the answer

#!csharp

bool outcome = 3 > 5;
Console.WriteLine("This condition is " + outcome);

#!markdown

## Else

Before, if the conditions of the if statement weren't met, the entire if statement was skipped. But what if you want something to happen in both cases? `else` is what happens if the conditional comes out false.

> Run this code, and change the conditional a couple times to see the different outcomes

#!csharp

int a = 5;
int b = 3;
if (a + b > 10)
    Console.WriteLine("The answer is greater than 10");
else
    Console.WriteLine("The answer is not greater than 10");

#!markdown

## Multi-line If statements

What if you want more complex code in your if statements? That's great, just add curly braces around what you want done.

> Try it out! Run the following code.

#!csharp

int c = 4;
if ((a + b + c > 10) && (a == b))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The answer is greater than 10");
    Console.WriteLine("And the first number is equal to the second");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The answer is not greater than 10");
    Console.WriteLine("Or the first number is not equal to the second");
}

#!markdown

`&&` means "and". It's a way to link up multiple conditionals. You can also use `||` as "or".   
  
  The if conditional above checks that adding a, b, and c up is greater than 10 AND that a equals b. If both are true, it goes into the if statement, but otherwise, it goes into the else part.

# Playground

Play around with what you've learned! Here's some starting ideas:  
> Try out the "or" symbol in place of the "and" in the code above. What do you need to do to get true vs false?
>
> What if you put if statements inside of if statements (a nested if statement)?
>
> Can you draw out the flow of an if statement? A nested if statement?

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Playground");
