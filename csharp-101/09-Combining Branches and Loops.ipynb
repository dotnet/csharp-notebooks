# Challenge: Combining Branches and Loops

Watch the full [C# 101 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK7tUpaOXi8&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVxKLQCHpiUWun7vlJJvUiN&index=11) for this module.

Here's a challenge:
>
> See if you can write C# code to find the sum of all integers 1 through 20 that are divisible by 3.  
>
First, try on your own, in this notebook below, or in Visual Studio, or in Visual Studio Code.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Challenge");

#!markdown

## Hints and Tricks:

- The `%` operator gives you the remainder of a division operation.
- The `if` statement gives you the condition to see if a number should be part of the sum.
- The `for` loop can help you repeat a series of steps for all the numbers 1 through 20.
- Getting a weird answer? try making some print statements of your variables, to see it they're changing unexpectedly.
