# Hello World

Watch the full [C# 101 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT2VR7m19So&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVxKLQCHpiUWun7vlJJvUiN&index=2) for this module.

## What do you do with this notebook?

This notebook is intended to help you learn the coding language C#. You can:

- Work through these notebooks on your own.
- Work through them while watching the C# 101 videos.
- Use these notebooks as prompts to write your own code in Visual Studio.

## What is C#?

It's a powerful and widely used programming language that you can use to make websites, games, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more. C# is part of the .NET programming platform, which includes libraries for all those applications. Learn C#, get started, and it'll give you the world.

## C#: Hello World

write your first C# program! It outputs a string "Hello World" to the console.
> Hover your mouse over the code below. On the left side, a little "play" icon should show up. Click that and the code will run!

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

#!markdown

`Console.WriteLine` is a method that is used to print a message to a text console. In this case, you specified "Hello World" as the output.

# Declare and use variables

A **variable** is a symbol you can use to run the same code with different values. For example, you can declare a new variable named `aFriend` that you can use with `Console.WriteLine` to output a string. You can declare this variable by using the type `string` or by using the `var` keyword that will automatically figure out the type for you.

> Go ahead and run the following code to see the output of **Jayme**.
>
> Next, change the name in the variable and run it again to see something different.

#!csharp

var aFriend = "Jayme";
Console.WriteLine(aFriend);

#!markdown

# Combining Strings

You may have noticed that the word "Hello" was missing from the last code block. You can fix it by combining multiple string together using `+` to create a new string that it output to the console.

> Run the code to write out a friendly welcome!

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Hello " + aFriend + "!");

#!markdown

# String Interpolation

You just used `+` to build a new string from a **variable** and a **constant**. There's a better way to do this by placing the variable between `{`and `}` to tell C# to replace that text with the value of the variable. This is called **string interpolation**. You can then add a `$` before the opening quote to enable string interpolation for the string.

#!csharp

aFriend = "string interpolation";
Console.WriteLine($"Hello {aFriend}!");

#!markdown

You did it! You just created your first C# application and learned about combining strings with string interpolation.

#!markdown

# Playground: Try it yourself

Each module will have a little "playground" at the end. This is a space for you to try writing some code yourself, instead of looking at prewritten code.
Try out printing words and variables! Here are some prompts to try:
> Print out a personal motto.
>
> Make some variables with your favorite foods, and then write a little story involving them.
>
> **Challenge!**
>
> Make your own Mad Libs! Make a few variables that are verbs, nouns, etcetera, and then use them when you write a story. Have a friend decide the value of each variable and read it to them for a laugh!

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Playground");
