## Working With Fixed Point types 

the `Decimal` type is similar to `double`s. They don't have as big a range, but they do have much higher precision.

> What's the range of a decimal type?

#!csharp

decimal min = decimal.MinValue;
decimal max = decimal.MaxValue;
Console.WriteLine($"The range of the decimal type is {min} to {max}");

> How do doubles and decimals compare in precision?

#!csharp

double a = 1.0;
double b = 3.0;
Console.WriteLine(a / b);

decimal c = 1.0M;
decimal d = 3.0M;
Console.WriteLine(c / d);

You can see that a decimals have a higher precision than doubles.

Play around with what you've learned! Here's some starting ideas:  

> Can you find the area of a circle with a radius 2.5 inches?
>
> What does the answer look like when you change number types, such as int, short, and decimal. 
>
> Hint: You can write `Math.PI` as pi, instead of writing the answer out
