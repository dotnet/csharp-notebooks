## Integer Math

You have a few `integers` defined below. An `integer` is a positive or negative whole number
> Before you run the code, what should c be?

#!markdown

## Addition

#!csharp

int a = 18;
int b = 6;
int c = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(c);

#!markdown

## Subtraction

#!csharp

int c = a - b;
Console.WriteLine(c);

#!markdown

## Multiplication

#!csharp

int c = a * b;
Console.WriteLine(c);

#!markdown

## Division

#!csharp

int c = a / b;
Console.WriteLine(c);

#!markdown

# Order of Operations

C# follows the order of operation when it comes to math. That is, it does multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.
> What would the math be if C# didn't follow the order of operation, and instead just did math left to right?

#!csharp

int a = 5;
int b = 4;
int c = 2;
int d = a + b * c;
Console.WriteLine(d);

#!markdown

## Using Parenthesis

You can also force different orders by putting parentheses around whatever you want done first
> Try it out

#!csharp

int d = (a + b) * c;
Console.WriteLine(d);

#!markdown

You can make math as long and complicated as you want. 
> Can you make this line even more complicated?

#!csharp

int d = (a + b) - 6 * c + (12 * 4) / 3 + 12;
Console.WriteLine(d);

#!markdown

## Integers: Whole numbers no matter what

Integer math will always produce integers. What that means is that even when math should result in a decimal or fraction, the answer will be truncated to a whole number.
> Check it out. WHat should the answer truly be?

#!csharp

int a = 7;
int b = 4;
int c = 3;
int d = (a + b) / c;
Console.WriteLine(d);

# Playground

Play around with what you've learned! Here's some starting ideas:  
> Do you have any homework or projects that need math? Try using code in place of a calculator!
>
> How do integers round? Do they always round up? down? to the nearest integer?
>
> How do the Order of Operations work? play around with parentheses.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Playground");
